# Hiya!

I'm Analia. I'm a Full Stack LAMP Developer working at [GeekHive](https://geekhive.com) :bee:. 
I primarily work in the CMS space, using Drupal 8/9 and WordPress. But I do dabble with Laravel, and 
React-based frameworks such as Gatsby and NextJS, all alongside TailwindCSS when I want to make
my side projects look nice :sparkles:.
